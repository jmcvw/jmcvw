## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is John, and I am a data scientist / analyst.
Most recently I worked as an instructor on the [data analysis courses](https://codeclan.com/courses/data-courses/) at  [![](images/CodeClan-Logo-White-2019-01.png)](https://www.codeclan.com).

I am most comfortable speaking in the [R](https://www.r-project.org/) language, but can also make myself undertood in Python, SQL, and JS.

I am currently learning more about Bayesian statistics and python programming.

### Currenrtly

With the recent liquidation of CodeClan, I am looking for work in a data related field.
In the meantime, I am hoping to continue helping the former CC students whose courses were cut short!

### Pre CodeClan

Prior to working at CC I was a researcher at the [University of Stirling](https://www.stir.ac.uk/).

For work I contributed to, see my [ORCID page](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2344-6155)
